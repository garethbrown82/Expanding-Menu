# Expanding Menu
This is a test page I created to experiment with different ways of having expanding menus. The page has no purpose or functionality beyond experimentation. This is to test functionality for hovering a mouse over the elements so it will only work on desktop, there is currently no responsive functionality.

You can view the page here: http://garethbrown82.github.io/expandmenu
